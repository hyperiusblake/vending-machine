Vending Machine Project

This is my first Capstone from my time at Tech Elevator, meant to display our proficiency with Object Oriented Programming in the C#/.NET language after 4 weeks.

We were paired off and given the task of creating a vending machine in VS Code, following some specific paramters, but for the most part we were left up to our own devices on how to execute the plan; we decided to implement a VendingMachine class, to work as the main "computer", connecting all of the methods and objects.

We used a StreamReader to pull the items from a txt.file, representing a fresh inventory every time the application is loaded.

Our bonus task was creating a sales log with a StreamWriter, and I decided to have some fun experimenting with .Beep() and ASCII art on the console. 

Getting to integrate my musical background into this first project was a big bonus for me!
