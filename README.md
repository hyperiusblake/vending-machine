Vending Machine Project

This is the project my partner and I completed in our first Module to display our proficiency with Object Oriented Programming in C#/.NET

We were given the task of creating a vending machine in VS Code, following specific paramters, but for the most part, we were left up to our own devices on how to execute the plan. 

Our bonus task was creating a sales log, and I decided to have some fun experimenting with .Beep() and ASCII art on the console. 
Getting to integrate my musical background into this first project was a big bonus for me. 

We decided to implement a VendingMachine class, to work as the main "computer", connecting all of the methods and objects.
